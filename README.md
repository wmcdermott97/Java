# Java repo

This repository is a simple repository for my newer Java projects, which serve as a demo of my coding ability / side projects. The hope is to rehone my Java
skills some with time to make sure that I'm appropriately approaching how to run some of these tests and to look alright on paper.

I may rework some of my old code into here with time, as I dust that code off and make sure it runs alright on the setups I have here.
